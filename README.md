📘 Overview

This project is a fully custom digital instrument cluster, integrating modern electronics with classic automotive character. The system replaces traditional analog gauges with a high‑resolution LVGL‑based graphical interface running on embedded hardware. It provides real‑time engine data, indicator status, and startup animations while preserving the spirit of the original car.

The cluster is designed to be modular, serviceable, and easily expandable as new sensors or features are added.


Hardware used:

Waveshare ESP32‑P4 DevKit,
JD9365 10.1" RGB Display,
USB‑JTAG + USB‑Serial.
